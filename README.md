# Engineering: Asset Tracking
[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/woojin444/EAssetTracking.svg)](https://github.com/woojin444/EAssetTracking/issues)

## Client's Vision

Thales' vision is to develop a tracking system to improve safety and efficiency of their personnel and equipment in dangerous environments such as mines and oil rigs. The clients expressed a broad scope for the project which was deemed difficult to complete in the given timeframe.
The focus of the project revolves around two unique parts:
1. > Market analysis<br />- What technologies are currently available that may address this problem?<br />- Is it possible to develop a solution utilising COTS components?<br />- Are there other organisations working in this area?
2. > High level architectural design of the solution including but limited to<br />- Requirements generation/analysis<br />- Functional flow/functional breakdown<br />- System/Subsystem interfaces

## Stakeholders

* Thales - Thales is investing time into the project for their future work and general interest in the technology. Therefore, no specific end users are currently in mind.
* Mining companies - Potential end users of the project.
* Oil companies - Potential end users of the project.

Please contact [Franklin Wilson](mailto:u5801853@anu.edu.au) or any other team member if you have any questions.

## Resources and Costs

The budget of $100 is available from the TechLauncher program and will mainly be spent on parts required for the prototype.

### [Team Meetings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cQXWK1z5KQEyvVXBOYfehOv8rlc7se-9)
Team gathers for weekly meetings, usually at the time of 8:00am - 10:00am on Wednesdays. The meetings consist of discussions of weekly tasks and goals as well as personal and team performance. This allows struggling members to get help from the team and fairly distribute workload for the week.

### [Tutor Meetings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BS8u5f6mCJD_adbbDQrrOebkBwqrG4UW)
During weekly tutor meetings, the team either perform an audit presentation or inform the tutor and the shadows of our progress. The tutor and oberservers will then provide recommendations allowing us to improve upon our work.

### [Client Meetings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n-N2s3irRv3vGNUbAsgqyEVSXxEOcGX5)
The team meetings with the clients fornightly to discuss the project. In this time, the team communicates with the client by asking questions and receiving feedback regarding the project. These meetings are held in Thales office complex off-campus for the convience of the clients.

## Tools

![GitHub](https://github.com/woojin444/EAssetTracking/blob/master/Landing/GitHub.png "GitHub")
**GitHub**
The team decided to utilize the issues function in GitHub as one of our main management tools. The team will rearrange issue cards between columns that represent "To Do", "In Progress", "Done" and such.
Furthermore, the source code and certain documents will be stored on GitHub in the interest of parallel workflow.

![C](https://github.com/woojin444/EAssetTracking/blob/master/Landing/CLanguage.png "C")
**Coding Language**
When building the prototype (estimated at week 7) our team will need to program some code. To do this our team is required to choose a programming language in which to program with. At this point in time it seems that the most likely language that we will use will be C. C is the most common language that the majority of the team have experience in. Another benefit is that it has applications in software and embedded hardware applications. 

![GoogleDrive](https://github.com/woojin444/EAssetTracking/blob/master/Landing/GoogleDrive.png "GoogleDrive")
**Google Drive**
Google drive will be used to manage documents containing research, meeting notes, planning, decisions and more. It will be separated into a private and public section to ensure the security of any confidential information provided by Thales. Only the public section will be available for viewing by observers. 

![Slack](https://github.com/woojin444/EAssetTracking/blob/master/Landing/Slack.png "Slack"){:height="200px"}
**Slack**
Our team has decided to use Slack as the main communication mechanism for team members. We found that it was best to have multiple different channel for different topics. This made it easier for us to keep track of conversations.
