## Tools

**GitHub**
Our team has decided to use the issues function in GitHub as one of our main management tools. The team will create issues for all tasks that need to be completed. The issues are then added to cards within the Projects feature within GitHub. These cards are then sorted into the To Do, In Progress, Needs Checking and Done columns. This feature allows our team to assign tasks effectively and track the project. 

**Coding Language**
When building the prototype (estimated at week 7) our team will need to program some code. To do this our team is required to choose a programming language in which to program with. At this point in time it seems that the most likely language that we will use will be C. C is the most common language that the majority of the team have experience in. Another benefit is that it has applications in software and embedded hardware applications. 

**Google Drive**
Google drive will be used to manage documents containing research, meeting notes, planning, decisions etc. It will be separated into a private and public section to ensure the security of any confidential information provided by Thales. Only the public section will be available for viewing by observers. 

**Slack**
Our team has decided to use Slack as the main communication mechanism for team members. We found that it was best to have multiple different channel for different topics. This made it easier for us to keep track of conversations.
